## A tiny game made with Javascript

The goal is pretty simple : make sure the protagonist gets to the office building to find a brand new job !! 
Use the arrow keys to do so (or q,z,d,s if you're more used to it)

### Four files to be efficient 
- HTML file as a basis
- CSS file for syling the page
- A game.js file to make it work
- An image folder for the icons used in the app and the wall background
- A readme file, that you are currently reading ^^
